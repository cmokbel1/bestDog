      <p>Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and thanks to its
      pleading expression cute. They were bred to hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally easygoing.
      There are two Beagle varieties:<ul>
        <li>those standing under 13 inches at the shoulder</li>
        <li>those between 13 and 15 inches</li>
      </ul>Both
      varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as dog folks say. They come in such pleasing colors as lemon,
      red and white, and tricolor. The Beagle's fortune is in his adorable face, with its big brown or hazel eyes set off by
      long, houndy ears set low on a broad head. A breed described as 'merry' by its fanciers, Beagles are loving and lovable,
      happy, and companionable'all qualities that make them excellent family dogs. No wonder that for years the Beagle has
      been the most popular hound dog among American pet owners. These are curious, clever, and energetic hounds who require
      plenty of playtime.</p></div>

      <div class="column-two-row-two"><h1>Why Beagles are the Best</h1>
        <p>Small, compact, and hardy, Beagles are active companions for kids and adults alike. Canines of this dog breed are merry
      and fun loving, but being hounds, they can also be stubborn and require patient, creative training techniques.
      
      Their noses guide them through life, and they’re never happier than when following an interesting scent. Beagles
      originally were bred as scenthounds to track small game, mostly rabbits and hare. They’re still used for this purpose in
      many countries today, including the United States. But you’ll find plenty of these pups living as companion dogs and
      loving, furry family members.
    
      It's difficult to resist the appeal of a Beagle's dark brown or hazel eyes, with his soft, pleading expression. They're
      happy, outgoing and loving — characteristics more than balanced out by their hound nature, which is inquisitive,
      determined, and focused on food.
      
      They aren't yappy dogs, but they do have three distinct vocalizations — a bark/growl, a baying howl, and a half-baying
      howl (a cross between a frantic bark and a bay). The half-howl vocalization usually is reserved for when they catch
      sight of quarry — or think it's time to wake the neighbors at 6 a.m.! Being pack dogs, they generally get along well
      with other animals and their human friends — and they think everyone is their new best friend.
      
      The most important thing to know about the Beagle is that he is a scenthound. His nose is the most important part of his
      anatomy and his head is always down to the ground, searching for an interesting trail to follow. Beagles have
      approximately 220 million scent receptors compared to the paltry 5 million or so in people, which makes them very good
      at picking up scents. Humorist Dave Barry once described his in-laws' Beagle as "a nose with feet."
      
      You may have seen the Beagle's nose at work at airports across the country. In 1984, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
      decided to use Beagles to sniff out contraband food being brought into the United States at the Los Angeles
      International Airport.
      
      The experiment was a huge success. Because they are small, friendly, and cute, the Beagles didn't intimidate people who
      are afraid of dogs, and with their super nose power, they could be trained to identify specific food articles while
      bypassing those that weren't contraband. Today, members of the "Beagle Brigade" patrol the baggage-claim areas at more
      than 20 international airports and other points of entry into the United States.
      
      Although they've branched out into other fields of work, Beagles remain superb hunters of small game. The National
      Beagle Club's Institute Farm hosts AKC-sanctioned field trials where breeders with packs are put to the test in the
      field. Many other countries have similar activities for hunting Beagles.
      
      Because of their small size and gentle temperament, Beagles can do well in apartments if their people are willing to
      walk them on lead several times a day in all kinds of weather. They need plenty of exercise, about an hour a day if
      possible. If left alone and unexercised, Beagles can become destructive.</p>

      <h2>Highlights</h2>
      
      <p>Beagles can be difficult to housetrain. Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate
      training is absolutely recommended.
      Beagles can get bored if left alone in a house too long. If left in a backyard, Beagles will start finding ways to amuse
      themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to escape.
      The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners'
      neighbors got tired of their baying. Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking
      and howling.
      Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in
      experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped!
      Since they are scenthounds, Beagles will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control
      their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world.
      Although they are loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is
      recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward
      (which few Beagles can resist).
      Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are "chow hounds" and will
      overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your
      trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best.
      In regards to food, your Beagle probably will take its food bowl pretty seriously. Teach children to respect your Beagle
      while it is eating, and not to approach it or tease it with food.
      Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they're usually friendly to everyone they meet.
